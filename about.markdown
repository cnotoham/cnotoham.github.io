I am a software engineer who is passionate on learning and experimenting new things.
I always question when someone claims to be a full stack developer. To me it is too broad.
So I will be more specific about myself.

I know enough the followings to get me into trouble:  
On the back-end stuff:  
.Net Core, .Net Framework, Azure Functions, MongoDB, Oracle, Kafka, Elasticsearch

On the DevOps stuff:  
Team City, Powershell scripts, Azure DevOps, Fastlane

On the front-end stuff:  
Angular, HTML, CSS, Javascript/Typescript, Node.js, Cordova, Ionic, Capacitor


I am using this platform as a way to motivate me to discover things so I can blog about them.
I am hoping that it is not just helping me to learn something new but in a way to also help others.

I will be open for discussions and so I encourage readers to comments, reacts and interacts to the blogs.
And of course should be within guidelines. Respect each other. Any abusive comments will not be tolerated and will be automatically removed from the discussions.
